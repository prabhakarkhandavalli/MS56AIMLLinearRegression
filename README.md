Bike Sharing System
Problem Statement
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

Based on various meteorological surveys and people's styles, the service provider firm has gathered a large dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on some factors.

Essentially the company wants to know:

- The factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands

## Conclusions
- Model r2 score is 0.811

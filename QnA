1. Explain the linear regression algorithm in detail
Ans. Linear regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm that predicts the outcome of an event based on independent variable data points. It is a statistical method used in data science and machine learning for predictive analysis.
Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the features and the target variable. The model learns the coefficents that best fit the data and can make predictions for new inputs.
Linear regression can be used to predict continuous or numeric variables. When independent features is one, then its known as Univariate Linear regression and in case if more than one feature its known as Multivariate linear regression.




2. Explain the Anscombe's quartet in detail
Ans. Anscombe's quartet is used to illustrate the imporatnce of exporatory data analysis and the drawbacks depending only on summary statistics. It also emphasizes the importance of using data visualization to spot trends, outlineners, and other crucial details that might not be obvious from the summary statstics alone.
Anscombe's quartet comprises four data sets that have nearly identical simple descriptive statstics, yet have very different distributions and appear veary different when graphed. The pecularities in the dataset can fool the regression model. 
It was constructed by statistician Francis Anscombe in 1973 to illustrate the imporatnce of plotting the graphs before analyzing and model building, and the effect of other observations on statistical properties.
